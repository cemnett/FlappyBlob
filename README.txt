Include a README.txt file to justify why your project is worth 100 points.  
For example: What was hard? 
Did you use any cool JavaScript libraries? 
What nifty features of your program were a bear to implement? 
What did you learn?

Our project is worth 100 points because we took a simple game and went above and beyond with it.
The added design of the game increases its aestetic value dramatically to provide a clean, visually appealing gaming experience.
We were able to put together a fun to place and cohesive looking game in a week which I believe justifies 100 points.

I had actaully never implemented a game so I really enjoyed learning the various tools as well as seeing how much math is involved 
in these kinds of games.
